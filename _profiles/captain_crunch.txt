Origins in the Hacking/Phreaking World: John Draper, better known as
Captain Crunch, began Phreaking when he found out that the whistle
included in a Cap'n Crunch Cereal box was 2600 hz, the perfect 
frequency to get a payphone to make an AT&T long distance phone call for
free. This became an important part of early phreaking, as the users
often had to pay expensive rates to use this service. However, by phreaking,
the power was back in the consumers hands. 

Later on, Captain Crunch developed Blue Boxes, devices that allowed 
phreakers to play whatever tones they needed to get payphones to 
allow the special calls. These boxes were even used, made, and sold
by the founders of Apple, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Some people
could argue that because of the Captain, the company Apple became what 
it is today. He was close with both the Steves, and was in a Homebrew 
Computer Club with them.

Captain Crunch was caught in the 1970's and served several years in
prison for his exploits. Despite this, he continued his ventures
into technology and got into CyberSecurity. Eventually, he even 
gave several talks at DEF CON and HOPE. 

Even though he began his work before modern hacking came to be, his
influence and attitude on society and bringing the power to the people
can be seen throughout the modern times. There still exists and attitude
now that power should be brought back into the hands of the people, 
and away from the corporations that grow wealthier and wealthier as 
the common man suffers. Captain Crunch was a legendary 
hacker, and deserves the respect of the community.
