## Assignment 2: Trusting Trust Response
Respond to a famous paper by Ken Thompson, co-creator of C and Unix: 
[Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210 https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf)

Choose 1 response type:
- History: Â½ page response on the paper above. Relate it to something you trust in real life, be it your locks or your academic advisor.
- Art: Make some art that invokes the same feelings Ken Thompson does in the paper above, ideally involving some sort of trust. 
- Tech: Implement something with NO SSL/TLS support like a website with password input, but no encryption on it. Demo how to steal the content (sniffing).
