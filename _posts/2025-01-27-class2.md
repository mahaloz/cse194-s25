## Class 2: Trusting Trust
A fundamental principle of being a hacker is understanding what is trustworthy and what is not. 
In this class, we will explore the concept of trusting trust, or the process of giving something your trust.

Halfway through the class time, we will also have a guest lecture by [Wil Gibbs](https://wilgibbs.com/) on Lock Picking, one of the earliest forms of Hacking. 
Wil, is a previous captain of the Shellphish Hacking team, is the current leader of the 2 million dollar [AIxCC](https://aicyberchallenge.com/) endeavor of that team (ARTIPHISHELL), and is a seasoned hacker.

## Assignment 2: Trusting Trust Response
Respond to a famous paper by Ken Thompson, co-creator of C and Unix: 
[Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210 https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf)

Choose 1 response type:
- History: Â½ page response on the paper above. Relate it to something you trust in real life, be it your locks or your academic advisor.
- Art: Make some art that invokes the same feelings Ken Thompson does in the paper above, ideally involving some sort of trust. 
- Tech: Implement something with NO SSL/TLS support like a website with password input, but no encryption on it. Demo how to steal the content (sniffing).
