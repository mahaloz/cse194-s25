## Class 4: Early Hackers: BBS
After Phreaking, hackers looked for a ways to share and save information efficiently. 
In the real world, bulletin boards acted as a way to share anonymous info with many people, and so, hackers made it virtual.
Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), because the go to method in the 80s for sharing information among hackers. 
In this class, we will explore what it was like to be a hacker then and how they used these BBSes.
