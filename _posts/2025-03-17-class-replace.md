## Class 8: Early Hackers: USENET & IRC
After the internet started spreading, so did the need to communicate instantly.
Thus, the era of the [Internet Relay Chat (IRD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) began!
Hackers begin talking to each other instantly, and with that, comes vulnerabilities and new culture. 

This class is specially lectured by **Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili**, a hacker now and back then.
