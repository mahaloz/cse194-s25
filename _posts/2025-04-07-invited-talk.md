## Guest Speaker: Chad Spensky
[Chad Spensky](https://www.cspensky.info) is the CEO of [Allthenticate](https://www.allthenticate.net/) and a hacker deeply invested in the history of hacking culture. 
He received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and was a member of the technical research staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.
Chad has competed in various DEF CON finals, and has a history of some epic CTFing.

In this special edition class, Chad will be giving us a look into some of his past in the hacking community.

## Assignment 10: A Response to Piracy
In Chad Spensky's talk, we learned about the complex infrastructure and organization that made up piracy networks in the 2000s. From racing uploads to IRC coordination, piracy is much more complex than it appears from the outside.
 
Respond to Chad's talk on piracy in one of three ways:
- Art: Anything that you think resonates with what Chad talked about. Please avoid generic things like a pirate ship.
- Written: In 250 words, what did you learn, and how does it influence your perspective of hacking culture?
- Tech: Any tech submission inspired by previous piracy or modern piracy. One project that may align well if you have no ideas is a hand-written packet splitter. When files are too big, you need to break them into small chunks. Make your own chunker and a receiver that can take chunks and put them back together, even when they come out of order.

If you missed the talk, you can also watch [Steal This Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Film) and respond to that.
