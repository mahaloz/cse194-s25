Napoleon Solo, aka Modem Master, was a true old-school 
phreaker from the early days of hacking. His journey kicked 
off in 1983 when he got his hands on a 300 baud Networker 
modem and started dialing into the tiny but thriving BBS 
scene. Eager to learn, he connected with 
the right people—most notably Simon Templar—who handed him 
his first 800-number code and pointed him toward legendary 
boards like IC's Socket, AT&T Phone Center, and Sherwood 
Forest.

From there, Solo took off, diving deep into exchange 
scanning, sniffing out PBXes, and even stumbling upon a 
hidden Sprint indial. The real game-changer, though, was 
Beandial, a Diversi-Dial system packed with top-tier phreaks. 
That’s where he built solid connections with 
names like Lord Kahz and even got a personal invite to King 
Blotto’s board—definitely a badge of honor back in the day.

Despite being all-in on the phreaking scene, Solo eventually 
got fed up with the wave of clueless kids who thought knowing 
a few codes made them elite. He stepped away for a while, but 
Taran King and Knight Lightning pulled him back in, proving 
that true phreaking wasn’t 
dead yet.

Outside of hacking, Solo was just a regular dude—grinding 
through computer engineering at North Dakota State while 
flipping burgers at McDonald’s. He had strong opinions, 
especially about credit card fraud, which he saw as lame and 
damaging to the real hacking community.

Napoleon Solo represents the essence of classic phreaking: 
curiosity, skill, and a passion for pushing tech to its 
limits. His story is a reminder of the days when hacking 
wasn’t about clout—it was about knowledge, connection, and a 
whole lot of late-night phone calls.

Unfortunately, there were not too many references to this guy 
outside of the main Phrack prophile. But I liked his name and 
thought he had a funny personality, so I decided to write on 
him anyways.
