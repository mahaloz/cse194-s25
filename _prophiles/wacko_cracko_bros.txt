             Handle: The W(hack)o Cracko Brothers (TWCB inc.)
              Names: Peter and Tim Roberts (Twins)
       Past handles: Unknown
      Handle origin: Unknown
      Date of Birth: 1970 actual date unknown
          Computers: Commodore(64) (assuming since they were cracking 
		     software for this device), 
		     IBM or HP (confirmed some type of UNIX system),
		     Hayes Modem
  Sysop/Co-Sysop of: Whackoland
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	TWCB grew up in Kirkwood, Missouri a small suburb of St. Louis. They 
got their start as teenagers writing software and exchanging messages on 
bulletin boards in the early 1980's.
Some examples of there work are cracked Commodore(64) games:
Aztec Challenge (https://csdb.dk/release/?id=144385)
The Pit (https://csdb.dk/release/?id=108705)
Caesar the Cat https://csdb.dk/release/?id=144328)

	They became quite active in the phreaking/hacking scene as one article 
noted:
"If you were a hacker or phreaker in St. Louis in the mid '80s (where Tim and 
Peter Roberts both lived), you probably knew of them. Even nationally, TWCB 
were well known."
 
The following is a timeline of TWCB's activity as noted from phrack.org.

Approx. Dec. 1984 (~14 Years old):
	Peter writes a code hacker for the Hayes modem and tells Tim NOT to 
use it on Sprint because they trace. However, Tim received a call from Scan 
Man, sysop of P-80, saying he needs some Sprint codes so Tim did it for him on 
the 314-342-8900 Sprint extender. But, Tim left it on all night and the next 
day at 9:00 AM agents from the FBI, and other agencies arrived at TWCB's 
house.
They each received probation and 100 hours of county service.

-Interesting Side Note: 
	There was some suspicion surrounding Scan Man around this time. He 
later asked another phreaker to get some codes and that person was also 
investigated!

Dec. 1985 (~15 Years old):
	The W(hack)o Cracko Brothers Inc. form the group Phreaks Against Geeks 
on a conference in December of 1985 as a joke about some nonsense that started 
on the Dartmouth (College) System and is mainly a local feud of phreaks in the 
Boston area. A follow up group was founded called Phreaks Against Phreaks 
Against Geeks.
(Noted this to point out the scope of this community but also it's pettiness)

Sometime between 1985 and 1986:
Whackoland BBS is up and running 300/1200 Baud, and 40 Megs.  
It has unique features as well as Elite Sections.  
Call today...  314-256-8220.   
Note: Only 100 users will be kept so if you are just a beginner please don't 
bother to call.

	Whackoland was made specifically to look like MS (Metal Shop, a very 
popular BBS and home of the Phrack Newsletter). TWCB was also going to have a 
magazine originally called "Whackoland Gazette" but TWCB started hearing about 
the revival of TAP and how the meetings were not going very well. They called 
Chesire Catalyst and started working out preliminary details.
(edited from ==Phrack Inc.== Volume One, Issue Four, Phile #10 of 11

Approx. Mar. 1986 (~16 Years old):
	TWCB was (allegedly) granted the TAP (Technological Assistance Program) 
magazine from Chesire Catalyst its last editor after sinking interest. Although 
comments from the time raise questions about this. Tim stated at one point 
after a failed meeting that "Cheshire sorta fucked TAP over. I think he was 
just in it for the money."
	It also seemed others weren't excited by TWCB reviving the magazine 
either, at one point they received a threatening call from TUC (employed at a 
competing mag), who informed them he "would have security people watching TWCB 
all the time and when they slipped up...*BOOM*".

-Interesting Side Notes: 
Scan Man was supposed to be a contributor but dropped himself from the TAP 
Staff.
The magazines supporting TAP included:
Mad Mad Magazine/High Times/Bootlegger Magazine/Hacker Magazine
	TUC was a good friend of Taran King the founder and sysop of Metal Shop 
also editor of phrack. He is also the creator of the first Pro-Phile that King 
based the rest of them on. (including this one lol.)

April 8, 1986:
	TWCB Inc. did not fulfill their promise of having TAP Magazine out by 
April 7, 1986.  When asked, they estimated that they could have it done in 
another four days.  This secondary deadline was also not achieved.

"Regardless of the TAP situation, Phrack will remain in publication.  TWCB is
not very happy about this but, we really don't care." -Knight Lightning

Current Day (adulthood):
	Both brothers did become highly successful entrepreneurs. Tim founded a 
venture capital firm, Broadband Investment Group LLP where he eventually came 
up with a new title for himself: chief visionary officer. Peter graduated from 
Southwest Missouri State University and started a locally based (St. Louis) 
business called Phoenix Networks. Of which his brother's firm invested $600,000.
