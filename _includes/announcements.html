  <p>Welcome to the first week of the Cybersecurity History and Culture class. Hopefully, you could attend the class today and watch the epic movie Hackers with us; however if you are a late-add to the class or could not make it, here is some important information below.</p>
  <p>You can find today&#39;s slides here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cse194-hh">https://tinyurl.com/cse194-hh</a></p>
  <p>There is no class next week (MLK Day)</p>
  <p>There are currently two assignments: Assignment 0 and Assignment 1, all submission is done through Canvas. The first is due in a week, and the second is due in two. The second assignment requires you to watch the movie Hackers (1995).</p>
  <p>Next class, I&#39;ll start taking attendance for the 15% specified in the syllabus, so make sure to show up :).</p>
  <p>Have a great week and start to the semester. If you have any questions, please email me at mahaloz@asu.edu (or the standard zbasque@asu.edu). Hack The Planet!</p>
