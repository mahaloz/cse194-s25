    <p>Welcome to the first week of the Cybersecurity History and Culture class. Hopefully, you could attend the class today and watch the epic movie Hackers with us; however if you are a late-add to the class or could not make it, here is some important information below.</p>
    <p>You can find today&#39;s slides here: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cse194-hh">https://tinyurl.com/cse194-hh</a></p>
    <p>There is no class next week (MLK Day)</p>
    <p>There are currently two assignments: Assignment 0 and Assignment 1, all submission is done through Canvas. The first is due in a week, and the second is due in two. The second assignment requires you to watch the movie Hackers (1995).</p>
    <p>Next class, I&#39;ll start taking attendance for the 15% specified in the syllabus, so make sure to show up :).</p>
    <p>Have a great week and start to the semester. If you have any questions, please email me at mahaloz@asu.edu (or the standard zbasque@asu.edu). Hack The Planet!</p>

    <p>This is both a reminder and an update announcement. Your assignment on responding to Trusting Trust is due on Sunday. I also have some updates about the next class and a later field trip.</p>
    <p><strong>Next class (Monday, Feb 3):</strong> we will be watching a movie (2hr) after the lecture. Feel free to bring snacks to enjoy during the film.</p>
    <p><strong>CactusCon 2025 (Friday, Feb 14):</strong> I have just added a new assignment, <a href="https://asu.instructure.com/courses/211698/assignments/6054456" title="CactusCon 2025 Registration">CactusCon 2025 Registration</a>, which is due <strong>next week Sunday</strong>. I will talk about this class field trip next week (including timing constraints with other classes), but I highly recommend you register for it this week (or weekend), as it is free right now. Please do it even if you think you have time conflicts.</p>
    <p>Have a good weekend!</p>
